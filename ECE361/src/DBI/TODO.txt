- Every time you submit 6 sets, end game is reached -- I did this on purpose so that we could test things out and ensure that scores get updated appropriately.

- We could work on USER permissions (only the founder of a room can start the game)

- We can decide what happens if everyone except one person leaves a started game

- Can users start games when only one person is in them?

- we need to test things out and see how well our concurrency is being handled.

- HTML encode the POPUP message when teh game ends.  This pop up should appear on everyones screen (that was in the current game,
unless they left early)

- Test that the DB gets updated CORRECTLY at the end of game.  I think its working,
but we need more testing.

- Run through playing multiple games in the same instance.

- Test game playing in general.

- Establish those concurreny rules we keep talking about ( in case 2 people submit the same set at the same time!)








This is how I have begun getting our VM ready:

	http://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-via.html
	
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
	
Git was already installed, so this is how I cloned the project:

	git clone https://github.com/JasonTam/ECE361.git

	
Opening port from firewall...

	sudo ufw allow 4444


Create the setServer JAR:

	Rigth click the package
	Export
	Runnable Jar File
	Select correct launch config
	Package required dependencies inside.
	DONE

Woot.. it worked:

	java -jar runnableServer.jar
	(just make sure you change the IP adderess in initGame);

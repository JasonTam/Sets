- Every time you submit 6 sets, end game is reached -- I did this on purpose so that we could test things out and ensure that scores get updated appropriately.

- We could work on USER permissions (only the founder of a room can start the game)

- We can decide what happens if everyone except one person leaves a started game

- Can users start games when only one person is in them?

- we need to test things out and see how well our concurrency is being handled.

- HTML encode the POPUP message when teh game ends.  This pop up should appear on everyones screen (that was in the current game,
unless they left early)

- Test that the DB gets updated CORRECTLY at the end of game.  I think its working,
but we need more testing.

- Run through playing multiple games in the same instance.

- Test game playing in general.

- Establish those concurreny rules we keep talking about ( in case 2 people submit the same set at the same time!)

-- IMPORTANT --
When the first person click START GAME, their start will automcatically get disabled.  However, the other users have to wait for the server response to disable their buttons.
This, the best solution might be to start the game ONLY after ALL players have clicked the button?
We need to address this.

This is how I have begun getting our VM ready:

	http://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-via.html
	
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
	
Git was already installed, so this is how I cloned the project:

	git clone https://github.com/JasonTam/ECE361.git

	
Opening port from firewall...

	sudo ufw allow 4444


Create the setServer JAR:

	Rigth click the package
	Export
	Runnable Jar File
	Select correct launch config
	Package required dependencies inside.
	DONE

Woot.. it worked:

	java -jar runnableServer.jar
	(just make sure you change the IP adderess in initGame);





How to create RegistrationServer jar

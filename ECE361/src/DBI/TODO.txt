- Every time you submit 6 sets, end game is reached -- I did this on purpose so that we could test things out and ensure that scores get updated appropriately.

- We could work on USER permissions (only the founder of a room can start the game)

- We can decide what happens if everyone except one person leaves a started game

- Can users start games when only one person is in them?

- we need to test things out and see how well our concurrency is being handled.


This is how I have begun getting our VM ready:

	http://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-via.html
	
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
	
Git was already installed, so this is how I cloned the project:

	git clone https://github.com/JasonTam/ECE361.git
